This option can be useful for creating a conservative estimate that is based on close prices only, thus avoiding the effects of intrabar repainting. This option assumes that the user does not enter when the signal first appears and instead waits for the bar to close as confirmation. On larger timeframes, this can mean entering after a large move has already occurred. Leaving this option disabled is generally better for those that use this indicator as a source of confluence and prefer estimates that demonstrate discretionary mid-bar entries. Leaving this option enabled may be more consistent with traditional backtesting results.",
